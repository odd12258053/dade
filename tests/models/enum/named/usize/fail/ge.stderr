error[E0277]: can't compare `usize` with `{float}`
 --> tests/models/enum/named/usize/fail/ge.rs:2:1

  | ^^^^^^^^ no implementation for `usize < {float}` and `usize > {float}`

  = help: the trait `PartialOrd<{float}>` is not implemented for `usize`
  = help: the following other types implement trait `PartialOrd<Rhs>`:
            f32
            f64
            i128
            i16
            i32
            i64
            i8
            isize
          and $N others
  = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `model` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
