  | ^^^^^^^^ no implementation for `f64 < {integer}` and `f64 > {integer}`

  = help: the trait `PartialOrd<{integer}>` is not implemented for `f64`
  = help: the following other types implement trait `PartialOrd<Rhs>`:
            f32
            f64
            i128
            i16
            i32
            i64
            i8
            isize
          and $N others
  = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `model` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider using a floating-point literal by writing it with `.0`
